Smart Logistics Platform
Welcome to the Smart Logistics Platform! This platform allows users to book logistics services for transporting goods across various locations in India. It offers features like real-time price estimation, transportation mode selection, booking management, and real-time tracking for drivers. Below is the detailed breakdown of the project:

Project Overview
The platform allows users to:

Book vehicles for transporting goods.
Estimate transportation costs based on the selected vehicle and distance.
Track drivers in real-time once a booking is made.
Fetch previous bookings and see booking history.
Drivers can:

Accept transportation requests.
Update the job status in real-time (e.g., en route, goods collected, goods delivered).
Admins can:

Monitor the fleet, track driver performance, and view analytics of trips completed.
The system is built to handle high scalability and real-time data for millions of users and drivers.

System Architecture
The system is designed using microservices with the following components:

Load Balancer: Distributes requests across multiple servers to handle high traffic.
Database Cluster: MongoDB cluster for storing user, driver, and booking data.
Real-Time Service: Powered by Socket.io for live GPS tracking and real-time updates.
Caching Layer: Redis for caching frequently accessed data (e.g., active bookings, available drivers).

How It Works
Booking Flow:
Users select the source and destination locations, type of vehicle, and calculate the cost using Google Maps API.
The cost is calculated based on the selected vehicle (Truck, Van, Car) and distance between the source and destination.
Upon confirmation, the booking is created, and the user is provided with a tracking ID for live vehicle tracking.
Price Calculation:
Truck: ₹40 per km
Van: ₹50 per km
Car: ₹100 per km
The distance between the source and destination is computed using Google Maps.
Real-Time Tracking:
Uses Socket.io to handle real-time vehicle location updates without overloading the system.

Challenges and Solutions
Scaling for High Traffic:
Implemented load balancers and horizontal scaling to handle 10,000 requests per second.
Real-Time GPS Data:
Optimized real-time tracking with Socket.io and Redis caching to ensure efficiency.
Future Enhancements
Add global region pricing and support for surge pricing based on demand.
Implement scheduled bookings for future transportation needs.
Extend the platform to support international users with multi-language support.
